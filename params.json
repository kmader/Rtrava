As shown here: [https://rawgit.com/kmader/Rtrava/master/stravaResults.html](https://rawgit.com/kmader/Rtrava/master/stravaResults.html)\r\n------\r\n\r\n# Making your own\r\n\r\nTo make your own, you basically just have to copy the first portion of the stravaResults.Rmd file up until ```summary.data, pl.data``` are defined. These are the useful variables for plotting everything else. \r\n\r\n## Heatmap\r\nA heat-map can be created using the following code which first pulls a black and white map at the scale 2 from the server and shows it with a 2d binning of the data on top. The bins are shown as hexagonal shapes (stat_binhex) and the filling is dictated by the ```log``` of the count (a count of 0 is not shown at all).\r\n```{r}\r\nmap.data<-get_map(location=c(lon=8.22190,lat=47.53733),color=\"bw\",scale=2)\r\nggmap(map.data)+\r\n  stat_binhex(data=pl.data,aes(x=lng,y=lat),alpha=0.5,bins=200)+\r\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rainbow(6),trans = \"log\")+\r\n  labs(y=\"Latitude\",x=\"Longitude\")+\r\n  theme_bw(20)\r\n```","google":"UA-48238118-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
